# TASK 5: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Implement a program that takes 3 users  inputs from the terminal or the Browser, and stores them in three variables. Return the largest of the three. Do this without using the the inbuilt max () function!
# The goal of this exercise is to think about some internals that programs normally take care of for us. 

num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

if num1 > num2 and num1 > num3:
    largest = num1
elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3:
    largest = num2
else:
    largest = num3
print("The largest number is:", largest)
